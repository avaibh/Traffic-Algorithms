# Traffic Algorithms
Used various algorithms to understand the traffic pattern and road connectivity between various cities. We created a macros that take binary inputs and implement algorithms, Depth First Search(DFS ), Kruskal’s Algorithm and Floyd’s Algorithm to detect the shortest or the cheapest route out of all possible connections.
An academic project that broaden the understanding and implementation of various Algorithms, and explain the use of them in various other fields of engineering.
