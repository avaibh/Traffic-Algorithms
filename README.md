# Traffic Algorithms
Used various algorithms to understand the traffic pattern and road connectivity between various cities. We created a macros that take binary inputs and implement algorithms, Depth First Search(DFS ), Kruskal’s Algorithm and Floyd’s Algorithm to detect the shortest or the cheapest route out of all possible connections.
